Abstract In this programming assignment, you will implement a Fibonacci function that avoids repetitive computation by computing the sequence linearly from the bottom up:F(0) through F(n). You will also overcome the limitations of C's 32-bit integers by storing very large integers in arrays of individual digits.

By completing this assignment, you will gain experience crafting algorithms of moderate complexity, develop a deeper understanding of integer type limitations, become acquainted with unsigned integers, and reinforce your understanding of dynamic memory management in C. In theend, youwillhaveaveryfastandawesomeprogramforcomputinghugeFibonaccinumbers.
